/*
 * emu_shim: everything the browser side of the emulator needs that is NOT
 * the real firmware. Three jobs, per docs/decisions/0003 and emu_abi.h:
 *
 * 1. Implements emu_abi.h - the lifecycle (emu_init/emu_tick), the panel
 *    (emu_fb, the emu_push_* window recorder), input (emu_touch,
 *    emu_button[_verdict], emu_sensor_event) and emu_device()'s JSON.
 *
 * 2. Implements sensors.h in full, so runtime_core.c and every app get a
 *    real touch queue, real key bits, real BOOT state and a real shake
 *    counter - fed by the functions in (1) - instead of talking to i2c1.
 *    This is the "browser supplies a touch controller, two buttons, and a
 *    clock" half of decision 0003's THE ONE IDEA.
 *
 * 3. Stands in for a few libc pieces the real firmware sources (gfx.c,
 *    apps/sketch.c and friends) call directly and that a freestanding,
 *    -nostdlib wasm build does not get for free: malloc() (a static bump
 *    allocator - see "malloc" below), printf() (a small local formatter -
 *    see "printf" below), and DEV_Delay_ms() (a no-op - see shim/DEV_Config.h).
 *    None of these are wasm imports; they are ordinary C compiled into this
 *    module, same as any other function here.
 *
 * 4. Implements sound.h (sound_play/sound_stop, called by apps/timer.c) by
 *    synthesising into a fixed buffer with sound_synth_alarm_sample() - the
 *    SAME function firmware/runtime/sound.c calls for the real board - and
 *    exposing it through emu_abi.h's sound section for the host to play via
 *    WebAudio. See that section for why this is genuine synthesis, not a
 *    JavaScript reimplementation, and what does not carry over (the timbre).
 *
 * Depends on emu_abi.h, runtime_core.h, app.h, gfx.h, sensors.h, sound.h,
 * sound_synth.h and freestanding headers only - this file is the "host", so
 * unlike runtime_core.c it is allowed to know it is running in wasm.

 * is simpler than a real allocator, costs nothing this program does not
 * already pay (the framebuffer has to live somewhere in linear memory
 * either way), and there is no second caller for a free-list to ever matter

 * board. Nothing here filters, maps axes or decides which edge is up: all
 * three live in tilt.c, which is compiled into this module unmodified, so
 * the emulator's orientation is the board's orientation. That is the same
 * "same object code, not a reimplementation" argument decision 0003 makes
 * for graphics and app logic and emu_abi.h extends to sound.
 *
 * SUBMITTED EVERY TICK, not once per emu_sensor_vector() call, and this is
 * not busywork: the filter is a function of elapsed time (tilt.h), so a
 * pose set once and held has to keep arriving for the filtered value to
 * converge on it, exactly the way the real part keeps reporting the same
 * gravity while the puck lies still on a table. A host that sets a pose and
 * then ticks sees it settle over tilt.h's 150ms time constant, same as a
 * hand holding the board still.
 *
 * The default is (0, 0, 1): lying flat on a table, screen up. Chosen as the
 * NEUTRAL pose - no in-plane gravity, so a ball does not roll and a bubble
 * sits centred until the host actually tilts something - and it is a real
 * pose a real device is in most of the time, not an invented one.
 *
 * These axes are the panel's own, so what arrives here is already what
 * tilt.h calls panel space. device_to_panel() inside tilt.c is therefore
 * the identity for this target BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by luck, which
 * is worth being explicit about: the emulator CANNOT be used to check the
 * board's real device-to-panel mapping. Only tilt.h's on-board ritual can.
 *
 * QUANTISED AND CLAMPED ON THE WAY IN, which is emu_abi.h's honesty rule
 * doing real work rather than being cited. The board's QMI8658 is left at
 * +-8 g by QMI8658_init(), giving acc_lsb_div = 4096 counts per g, i.e.
 * 0.244 mg (0.000244 g) per count (firmware/runtime/sensors.c's own
 * QMI8658_ACC_LSB_DIV comment derives exactly this). A host handing over
 * 1.00037 g is handing over a reading no register on this part can hold,
 * and an app tuned against it would be tuned against fiction. So the value
 * goes through the same round trip the hardware imposes: clamp to the
 * range, quantise to the LSB, convert back - before it ever reaches
 * tilt.c's filter, the same way a real out-of-range or off-grid sample
 * never reaches it on the board either.
