 * runtime: the board's entry point. Split from what used to be this whole
 * file per docs/decisions/0003-emulator-runs-the-real-apps.md: the arena,
 * the app table, app switching and the per-frame dispatch are now
 * runtime_core.c, portable and hardware-blind. What is left here is
 * everything that IS hardware: startup ordering, the watchdog, the
 * devlink wiring, the once-a-second profiler, and this file's
 * implementation of the three small hooks runtime_core.h declares
 * (rt_log, rt_time_us, rt_halt) - see runtime_core.h's header comment for
 * why those three exist at all.
 *
 * What used to live in firmware/main.c and is deliberately NOT here any
 * more (this predates the runtime_core split, carried over from this
 * file's original header comment):
 *   - the sketchpad's stroke reconstruction (now apps/sketch.c's problem);
 *   - appswitch.c's reboot-to-other-slot dance (switching is a function call
 *     now; the store/ partitions are a crash-recovery fallback, not how apps
 *     change - see docs/decisions/0002 section 6, and the watchdog note
 *     below for how that fallback and this runtime's own watchdog coexist);
 *   - a KEY_SHORT-triggered full-panel refresh (apps own their pixels now,
 *     they push what they change; a blanket refresh on every short press
 *     was a sketchpad-only convenience, not something every app wants).
