/* ---- landscape helpers --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Lifted unchanged from firmware/rot.h's land_to_panel_rect() /
 * fill_rect_land() / push_dirty_land(). Mapping: landscape (lx, ly), lx in
 * [0, LAND_W), ly in [0, LAND_H), maps to panel (px, py) =
 * (PANEL_W - 1 - ly, lx). Rotated so the wanted orientation, buttons along
 * the top edge, comes out right; see apps/chrono/main.c's git history for
 * the (rejected) 90-degrees-the-other-way mapping that came out upside down
 * on real hardware.
 *
 * Corners of a landscape rectangle (lx, ly, w, h) under that map:
 *   (lx,     ly    ) -> (PANEL_W-1-ly,       lx      )
 *   (lx+w-1, ly    ) -> (PANEL_W-1-ly,       lx+w-1  )
 *   (lx,     ly+h-1) -> (PANEL_W-1-(ly+h-1), lx      )
 *   (lx+w-1, ly+h-1) -> (PANEL_W-1-(ly+h-1), lx+w-1  )
 * px spans [PANEL_W-(ly+h), PANEL_W-1-ly], a run of length h.
 * py spans [lx, lx+w-1], a run of length w.
 * So the panel rectangle is (px = PANEL_W-(ly+h), py = lx, width = h,
 * height = w): width and height swap, as any 90 degree rotation must.
