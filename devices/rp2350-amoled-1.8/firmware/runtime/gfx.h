/*
 * gfx: the framebuffer and the panel push, owned by the runtime.
 *
 * This exists because the three rules below were, until this file, copied
 * into four places (firmware/main.c, apps/chrono/main.c, firmware/menu.c and
 * firmware/rot.h's contract) and every copy was one edit away from drifting
 * out of sync with the others:
 *
 *   1. every pushed window's row length must be a multiple of 8 pixels,
 *      or AMOLED_1IN8_DisplayWindows corrupts the transfer
 *      (docs/decisions/0001-push-min-width.md - this one cost days);
 *   2. the framebuffer is byte-swapped RGB565, because it is DMA'd out raw;
 *   3. landscape apps draw through a rotation, portrait apps do not.
 *
 * An app never calls AMOLED_1IN8_DisplayWindows itself. It draws into the
 * framebuffer and names a dirty rectangle; gfx is what makes that rectangle
 * legal. That is the whole point of centralising it: an app cannot violate
 * the 8-pixel rule because an app is never in a position to.

// DEV_Config.h first, and not by accident: the vendor's AMOLED_1in8.h uses
// UWORD and UBYTE without including whatever defines them, so it only
// compiles in a translation unit that already pulled DEV_Config.h in. Every
// vendor demo happens to satisfy that by ordering its includes a particular
// way in main.c, which is why upstream never noticed. Including it here
// makes gfx.h self-contained instead of leaving the trap for the next file
// that includes it first.

// How many pixels, along EVERY edge, the physical case hides. The
// framebuffer is the panel's full 368x448 and the firmware addresses all
// of it - this is not a drawing bug, it is the visible area being smaller
// than the glass. Found 2026-08-14 from a photograph of the real device
// (the owner's own sketchpad palette had its outer row and columns
// running under the case): "l'ecran est legerement plus tronque que
// prevu... je pense que tu peux shave quelques pixels sur les bords".
//
// THE NUMBER IS DELIBERATELY ROUGH. A photograph taken at an angle cannot
// measure a bezel to the pixel, and this is not trying to: 10 is an
// order-of-magnitude guess, conservative (a little too much margin costs
// a little less canvas; a little too little leaves the exact defect this
// exists to fix). Tunable in this ONE place on purpose, so the owner can
// judge the real device and either of us can correct it in one edit
// without hunting down every app that used it.
//
// EVERY APP THAT DRAWS EDGE TO EDGE NEEDS THIS, not just the one that
// found it - the sketchpad's own colour palette was the first (see
// firmware/apps/sketch.c's own use of it), and Connect Four's board is
// the next, already in flight in another agent's own change. The rule
// this constant exists to enforce, for every app from now on: nothing a
// child needs to actually see - a button's own edge, a rounded corner, a
// piece of text - belongs inside PANEL_BEZEL_MARGIN_PX of the panel's own
// boundary. A shape clipped by a straight framebuffer edge is invisible
// in the emulator, which has no bezel to hide anything behind by
// definition (decision 0003) - a human looking at the real device is the
// only test that will ever catch this, which is exactly why the margin
// gets a name and a shared home instead of staying a fact only one app's
// own code happened to know.

 * down on real hardware.

 * two landscape apps (chrono, timer) draw only rectangles, by construction:
 * their digits are seven filled bars.
