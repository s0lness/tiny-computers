/*
 * devlink: a tiny line-oriented command protocol over the same USB CDC port
 * the runtime already prints debug output to, so an agent can see and drive
 * the device without a human touching it.
 *
 * Integration contract:
 *   - Call devlink_init() once, after the framebuffer and every hook
 *     function below exist (typically right after gfx_init() succeeds,
 *     before the main loop starts). See runtime.c's "devlink wiring"
 *     section for the actual hook implementations.
 *   - Call devlink_poll() once per main-loop iteration. It never blocks
 *     waiting for input: it drains whatever bytes are already queued on
 *     stdin and returns. It only spends non-trivial time when a full SHOT
 *     command has been received, while it writes the screenshot out.
 *
 * See tools/README-devlink.md for the wire protocol.

// raw sensors.h KEY_PRESS/KEY_LONG/KEY_SHORT/KEY_RELEASE bit values:
// devlink.c stays hardware-blind (it does not include sensors.h and does not
// know a PMIC register from a GPIO), so it speaks in names and leaves the
// mapping to whichever bit each name means to the runtime's own hook
// implementation (see runtime.c's "devlink wiring" section). This is also,
// separately, why the wire protocol spells these out as words rather than
// taking a raw hex mask: see tools/README-devlink.md's KEY section for that
// reasoning.
//
// DEVLINK_KEY_RELEASE added alongside the PWR-held-alone power-off gesture
// (runtime_core.c): that gesture needs to know when a hold ENDS, which
// KEY_PRESS/KEY_LONG/KEY_SHORT cannot express on their own, and there was no
// way to complete (or cancel) an injected hold without it - see
// tools/README-devlink.md's KEY section for how this gap was found.
